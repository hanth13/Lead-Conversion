World Plus, a mid-size private bank, sought to improve lead identification for cross-selling a new term deposit product to existing customers. This project focused on developing a lead prediction system to maximize profits from cross-selling while minimizing marketing expenses. Using the CRISP-DM methodology, we tested several machine learning algorithms, ultimately selecting Naive Bayes as the most effective model, offering a recall rate of 68.21% and the highest potential profitability for the bank.
